# V8 engine
## core pieces

V8 is made up of a few core pieces:
* base complier
* object model
* runtime profiler
* optimizing compiler
* deoptimization
* garbage collector
## Garbage Collection

Garbage collection is a form of memory management.

Avoid using __delete__, as it changes hidden class and makes it a generic slow object.

Globals object will stick around, unless you refresh, navigate to a diffenet page. Function-scoped variables get cleaned up when a variable falls out of scope. When functions have exited and there arenâ€™t any more references to it, the variable gets cleaned up.

## Closures

When you see a function that returns an inner function, that inner function will have access to the outer scope even after the outer function is executed. This is basically a closure -- an expression which can work with variables set withnin a specific context.
